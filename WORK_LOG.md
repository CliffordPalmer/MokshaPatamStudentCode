| April 5     |  9-10pm   |                                                                                                                            I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 4 | 8:20-8:50 |          Worked a little on figuring out how to solve the problem. Felt a lot like the trees we were doing last year, so I've started searching the tree of positions |
| September 4 | 8:50-9:20 | Continue working on searching. I think I'm technically traversing the tree, but not actually saving any paths or anything. Just added a Space class to deal with that |
