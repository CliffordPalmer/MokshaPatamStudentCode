| April 5     |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                            I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 3 |  8:20-8:50pm  |          Worked a little on figuring out how to solve the problem. Felt a lot like the trees we were doing last year, so I've started searching the tree of positions |
| September 3 |  8:50-9:20pm  | Continue working on searching. I think I'm technically traversing the tree, but not actually saving any paths or anything. Just added a Space class to deal with that |
| September 4 | 10:40-11:15pm |                                   Applied the things we talked about in class, added array which just directly tells when a space is a snake or ladder for effeciency |
| September 5 | 11:15-11:55pm |                                                                        Starting getting actual (wrong results) Have been debugging for basically the whole 40 minutes |
